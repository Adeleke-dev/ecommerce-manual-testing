  Test Results Summary
Test Result: Partially Passed

Blocked?: No

Major Failures:

No validation for duplicate emails or usernames

Weak handling of password length and input sanitisation

Recommendation: Defects must be resolved before proceeding to the UAT phase.

  Conclusion
The user registration feature is not yet stable for release. While core functionality works under ideal conditions, several key negative path issues exist (duplicate handling, field validation). These must be resolved before deployment.
