# UAT Criteria – User Registration Module

1. Business Objective
To ensure that new users can register on the e-commerce platform securely and
without errors, with complete validation of input fields, uniqueness of email/username,
and confirmation of successful registration.

| 4     | Password and confirm password fields must match before form submission.                             | ✔️                                   |
| 5     | Password field must enforce minimum and maximum length limits.                                      | ❌ (BUG-104)                          |
| 6     | Input fields must reject or sanitise special characters where not allowed.                          | ❌ (BUG-103, BUG-105)                 |
| 7     | The system must trim leading/trailing spaces before validation or storage.                          | ❌ (BUG-105)                          |
| 8     | The registration process must show a success message or redirect upon successful completion.        | ✔️                                   |

3. Entry Criteria for UAT
Functional and integration testing is complete.

Major defects are resolved or deferred with mitigation.

Test environment mimics production.

The latest build is stable and deployed for UAT.

UAT scenarios and test cases are reviewed and approved.

4. Exit Criteria for UAT
All critical and high-severity defects are resolved and verified.

≥ 95% of UAT test cases are passed.

No open showstopper issues.

Stakeholders sign off on UAT completion.

5. UAT Risk Areas
Validation inconsistencies (e.g., username/email uniqueness).

Weak error messaging for input handling.

Overlooked UI/UX gaps in validation feedback.


Conclusion
UAT Readiness:  Not ready until defects BUG-101 through BUG-106 are resolved
UAT can begin only after critical and high-priority bugs affecting validation and security are addressed.
